<h1>Command and Control (C2) Framework Project</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a demonstration of a Command and Control (C2) framework developed for educational and research purposes. The C2 framework is designed to simulate the interaction between a server (the command center) and clients (agents) in a controlled environment. It's crucial to note that this framework is strictly for ethical hacking, cybersecurity training, and research.</b> 





<b>Features:

Server-Client Architecture: The framework follows a server-client model where the server issues commands and clients execute them.

Basic Authentication: Implements basic authentication to ensure secure communication between the server and clients.

Encrypted Communication: All communications are encrypted to maintain confidentiality and integrity.

Custom Command Protocol: Utilizes a custom protocol for issuing and receiving commands, demonstrating the flexibility of the framework.
